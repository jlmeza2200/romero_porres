                MINNEAPOLIS — May 26, 2020 — Nerdery, a leading digital
                consultancy, was named the winner of a Bronze Stevie® Award in
                the Migration as a Service category in the 2020 American
                Business Awards®. Nerdery was selected for its agnostic and
                holistic consulting approach to cloud migration.
              </p>

              <p>
                From initial analysis and discovery, all the way to execution
                and delivery, Nerdery clients receive a dedicated team of
                professionals who guide them through the entire cloud
                transformation project. Nerdery helps clients navigate through
                an array of cloud adoption choices, taking into consideration
                the client’s industry, the applications the business leans on
                the most, and its long-term goals.
              </p>

              <p>
                “At Nerdery, we know our clients have unique business needs,
                which is why we help them design the cloud environment that best
                fits their business model,” said Sean Feeney, cloud practice
                director at Nerdery. “By staying up to date on the latest trends
                and services, our team of experts drive decision making with our
                clients based on what will provide them with the most
                efficiency, security and cost savings. From there, we stand by
                them through the entire cloud migration process to ensure they
                see the most return on investment and to consider the benefits
                of innovative cloud services like artificial intelligence,
                machine learning and automation.”
              </p>

              <p>
                The premier business awards program received more than 3,600
                nominations from organizations of all sizes and in nearly every
                industry for consideration in a wide range of categories. The
                winners were determined by the average scores of more than 230
                professionals worldwide in a three-month judging process.
                Nerdery received high scores for its ability to build client
                trust and migrate quickly and easily to multiple cloud
                platforms, including AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
              </p>

              <p>
                “It’s refreshing to see a provider-agnostic consultancy,” said a
                judge assigned to Nerdery’s nomination. “Typically you have to
                select your provider and then find the best consultant, or
                multiple consultants, in the target areas. Nerdery has
                capabilities and expertise across providers in order to guide
                their customers to the best decision.”
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond recognition for its cloud services, Nerdery was also
                named a finalist in the 2020 SIIA CODiE Awards in the Best Event
                Technology Solution category for its work in developing the
                digital experience, an app and web interface, for Google Cloud
                Next. The final solution, which allowed attendees to book
                sessions and watch live streams, resulted in 33,000 app
                downloads (up 32% from 2018) and 300,000 livestreamers. In
                anticipation for this year’s virtual event, Google Cloud Next
                ‘20: OnAir, Nerdery is building on this digital experience to
                accommodate nine weeks of 200 virtual sessions. For more
